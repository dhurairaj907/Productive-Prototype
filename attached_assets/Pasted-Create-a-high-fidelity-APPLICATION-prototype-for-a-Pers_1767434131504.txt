Create a high-fidelity APPLICATION prototype for a 
“Personal Financial Management (PFM) System”
designed as:

• Mobile Application (Android-first)
• Web Application (Responsive dashboard)

This is an APPLICATION-based system, not a static website.

The UI should be modern, secure, minimal, and finance-focused,
with smooth navigation and clear data visualization.
